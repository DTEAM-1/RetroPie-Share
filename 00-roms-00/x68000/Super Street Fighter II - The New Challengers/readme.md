insufficient memory error : Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers.hdf

md5sum : d56faf3cdf7d6ee12f911294df14f121

should work too on dim's and hdm's versions

I started the HDD version and it stopped at the A> prompt.

I used the translation button to translate the Japanese text above the A> prompt.

The translation was => insufficient memory .

Used the RetroArch gui (key F1) to change the settings and rebooted.

Then it was too slow so I also did the CPU overclock 200Mhz.

You can also save a game specific opt file in the same gui if you want (first option).

I have added this opt file in here :

I also used F12 because discs from earlier seem to be remembered.

Select : SYSTEM - RESET
